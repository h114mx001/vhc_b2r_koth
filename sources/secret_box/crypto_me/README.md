0x1ce told me that the JWT token is used a lot in the wild... I wonder if I can break the signatures or not... But seems like they are so strong with 256-bit security of AES T.T

Or? I don't even need to break the signature?

Please run 

```bash
./crypto_me_first

to run the challenge in the "intended" way.
